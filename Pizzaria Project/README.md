# Entertainment Pizzaria

The idea of this project was to build the database of an app in which people could order pizza and, if they wanted, they could order a especial delivery made by an entertainer.</br> 
There were three different types of clients that could use the app: pizzaria owners, entertainers and "hungry clients".
